# Verbose mode

Request informations can be displayed by setting `options("rgho.verbose")` to `TRUE`.

# Memoisation

Request results are memoised. The results of requests are cached, and repeating a request with the same parameters will return the cached result without doing a new query.

The cache is cleared after a delay in order to avoid returning out-of-date data. By default this delay is set to  `options("rgho.memotime")` seconds (by default `r options("rgho.memotime")`).

# Proxy settings

`rgho` tries to fetch MS Windows proxy settings with `curl::ie_get_proxy_for_url()`. If a list of proxies is returned the request will loop over the list until it succeeds.

# Retry failed requests

Failed requests are retried a maximum of `options("rgho.retry")` (by default `r options("rgho.retry")` times).
